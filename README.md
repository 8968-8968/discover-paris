# "Discover Paris" Website Project
## Abstract
*Discover Paris* is a website project for my web design class.
## More Detailed Definition
*Discover Paris* is a website that I needed to create for my travel website project in my web design class. I decided to publish it to GitHub in case anyone wanted to copy it for their own educational use. I am still working on development, so please mention any bugs in [Issues](https://github.com/8968-8968/discover-paris/issues) if there are any. If anyone wants to use this code, thank you.
